// Indicates whether the stream is reusable, which means that it can be bound to
// multiple broadcasts. It is common for broadcasters to reuse the same stream
// for many different broadcasts if those broadcasts occur at different times.
// If you set this value to false, then the stream will not be reusable, which
// means that it can only be bound to one broadcast. Non-reusable streams differ
// from reusable streams in the following ways:
// - A non-reusable stream can only be bound to one broadcast.
// - A non-reusable stream might be deleted by an automated process after the
// broadcast ends.
// - The liveStreams.list method does not list non-reusable streams if you call
// the method and set the mine parameter to true. The only way to use that
// method to retrieve the resource for a non-reusable stream is to use the id
// parameter to identify the stream.
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *isReusable;  // boolValue
